## Assignments

### Assignment 1: News Portal

**Description:** This project demonstrates the use of **NewsAPI** to fetch news articles using the `everything` endpoint. Key features include:

- **Search Functionality:** Allows users to search for news articles and get results with related titles.
- **Pagination:** Navigate to next and previous pages using pagination controls.
- **Topic Filtering:** Users can filter news articles by common topics using a dropdown menu.

Technologies used include **Tailwind CSS** for styling, **Redux Toolkit** for state management, and efficient handling of loading states and errors with **React's `useState()` hook**. Through this assignment, I enhanced my skills in API integration, pagination, and learned the importance of meeting project deadlines, time management, and responsibility.
